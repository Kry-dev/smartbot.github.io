# front-end-boilerplate

## Branch information
New branch using vanilla javascript over JQuery and now also forgoing pre-frameworking for CSS... what's the point of the bloat when you can code fast?! ;)

Also removal of font functionality, because native font stacks are COOL and FAST.

ALSO, also removed Swiper and a lot of optional modules/frameworks that are going to be project specific, I want this LEAN as a BEAN to start with. Obviously, these optional modules are good as add ons to this core IF needed.
